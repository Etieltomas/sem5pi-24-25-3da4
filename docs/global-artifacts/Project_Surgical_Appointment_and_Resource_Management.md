# Project Surgical Appointment and Resource Management

## 1. Project Description

The project aims to develop a **prototype system** for managing surgical requests, appointments, and resource allocation in hospitals and clinics. This system will enable the management of surgery schedules and patient records while providing real-time 3D visualization of resource availability within medical facilities. Furthermore, it will optimize scheduling and resource utilization, ensuring GDPR compliance by integrating privacy policies and data protection mechanisms.

### System Users:
- **Admin**: Manages system users and oversees GDPR compliance.
- **Healthcare staff (Doctor, Nurse, Technician)**: Manages patient records, requests operations, and participates in scheduling surgeries.
- **Patient**: Interacts with the system to view and book surgical appointments.
- **Operator**: Monitors the system, ensuring the automated processes run smoothly.

### Key Features:
- **Surgery Appointment Scheduling**: Optimizes surgery schedules based on available resources and staff.
- **3D Visualization Module**: Provides real-time visual representation of the hospital's resources (e.g., available rooms, equipment).
- **GDPR Module**: Ensures compliance with data protection regulations, allowing patients to control and manage their personal data.
- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: Ensures system reliability and failover mechanisms.

### Legal and Compliance:
All modules must adhere to GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679, ensuring users have full control over their data and access to privacy policies.
