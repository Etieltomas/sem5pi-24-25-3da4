# US 5.1.17

## 1. Context

The task was assigned to be developed in the current sprint (Sprint 1)

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.17** As a Doctor, I want to update an operation requisition, so that the Patient has
access to the necessary healthcare


*** Acceptance Criteria: ***
- Doctors can update operation requests they created (e.g., change the deadline or priority).
- The system checks that only the requesting doctor can update the operation request.
- The system logs all updates to the operation request (e.g., changes to priority or deadline).
- Updated requests are reflected immediately in the system and notify the Planning Module of any changes.


**Priority:** 1

**Dependencies/References:**

- **References:** n/A
- **Dependencies:** n/A


## 3. Analysis

### 3.1. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

 - ***Question:*** You want to log all updates to the operation request. Do you plan to have this info available in the app or is this just for audit purposes ?
 -
 -***Answer:*** The history of the operation type definition is part of the application's data. if the user needs to view the details of an operation that was performed last year, they need to be able to see the operation configuration that was in place at that time

### 3.2. Input and Output Data
**Input:**
*  Operation Request ID, informantion to change on deadline or priority

**Output:**
* In/Sucess of operation
